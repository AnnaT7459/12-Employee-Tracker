# Employee Tracker

## Description
If I was a business owner, I would want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company so that I could organize and plan my business. I learned a lot about SQL and creating queries with JavaScript functions. I also learned a lot with the help of a tutor on how to use the console table printer so I could easily see the data in columns and rows.
